md"""Pacioli.jl is a double entry bookkeeping package, to allow accounting to be done in Julia, and especilly within Pluto.  Written in Julia and Markdown, it's intended to allow for a printable document to be created in Pluto."""
A link to a tutorial will be added in the next few days.  Check out issues and projects, to make this a more useful package, that can be properly released.
